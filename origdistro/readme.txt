This is the canonical distribution of the brainfuck programming language,
Urban Mueller's version 2. This copy was taken on 05/28/04 from
ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/lang/ and was dated 06/09/93. The
original files are brainfuck-2.lha and brainfuck-2.readme, and I have provided
an unpacked copy of the former for convenience.
